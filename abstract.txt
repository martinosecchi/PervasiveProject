Technology enhanced trash cans have already been subject to research and have become available as market products.
Fundamental features are the ability to know how much they have been filled and to communicate such information for urban planning purposes or logistics optimization.
In this paper, we will discuss our approach in building a prototype that involves smell sensors able to capture and measure bad odor emitted from the trash, in terms of gases bioproducts of decomposition.
This approach allows smart bins to be used in more and different scenarios than the average products available.
We will present hardware characteristics, produced information, test cases and discuss the results.
