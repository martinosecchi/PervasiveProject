The software consist of two components. One cloudservice and one android client.

The android client can provide statistics about different smartbins - it only supports  presentation of data in its current form.
It supports two modes: \textbf{Admin mode} and \textbf{Single Bin mode}.
Admin mode includes overview of every single bin and graphs for each bin. The graphs are only available as long as enough context information is present.
 \todo{insert some sweet a\$\$ images of the app}
 Single bin mode provides a view of the current bin state.
 
 The bin state is divided into five different categories, this is represented visually as colors.
 The order is, \textit{blue}, \textit{dark green}, \textit{green}, \textit{orange}, and \textit{red}.
 \todo{do a color bar?}
 The middle one, \textit{green}, is when the concentration is deviating with at most 5\%, next tier \textit{dark green} and \textit{orange} is a deviation of at most 25\%, and the last ones \textit{blue} and \textit{red} are deviations above 25\%.
