In this section we describe the overall system characteristics proposed for our approach to waste management.\\
The SmartBin system is composed of two main components:
\begin{itemize}
\item sensory layer: responsible of producing information.
\item information layer: responsible of collecting and presenting information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{sensory layer}
The sensory layer has two sensors and one communication device. The sensors detect the state of the bin.
Our approach relies on two kinds of information related to the state of the bin: smell and fill level.
For this reason, the sensory part of the system is of key importance, since it enables the information to be perceived and registered by the system.
An odor detection sensor is able to capture volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other gases, typical bioproducts of food decomposition, commonly associated with bad smell. 
Some examples are Hydrogen Sulphide, Ammonia, Toluene and others.
The smartbin sends the raw values of VOC concentration to the information layer.

The other type of sensor is a ultrasonic distance measurement unit. This is used to get the distance to the bottom of the bin.
This type of information is processed in the sensory layer to reflect the amount of thrash filled in the bin.

\subsection{information layer}
Having obtained the information is only the first step though, the next one is to make it available.
Our system uses a web service for collecting the data and storing it in a database, making it accessible to potential consumers.
The service supports two types of entities. The SmartBins and the contexts.
In short a SmartBin represent the hardware instance of a smartbin, this includes information such as location expressed as coordinates, unique identifier, 'calibration' which is the intial air quality level(raw value of VOCs when empty) and meta information about the last associated context.
This ensures that status of every bin is readily available without having to traverse the contexts.

The contexts model a snapshot of a bins state at a given time.
