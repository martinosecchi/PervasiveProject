Waste management is a constant issue, that is dealt with on the daily by different organisations.
According to Eurostat, the countries in europe have had a rather stable production, while some countries fluctuate towards higher productions of waste other countries produce less.
The above supports the claim that waste management is highly relevant in a post modern society.

However waste management has been traditionally perceived from a logistical point of view.
Imagine not the amounts nor the location of the bin being the driving force for picking it up, but rather its smell.
This is the essential feature of our system - the additional parameter, which can be used in conjunction with existing systems or used to produce entirely new experiences centered around the waste bin.
