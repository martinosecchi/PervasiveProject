The SmartBin system which has been constructed utilizes gas sensors to open up an additional dimension when measuring the state of the environment, in which it has been placed.

This extra dimension provides values of various gas concentrations in the current environment.
In short these values will be used in an evaluation of how the current environment is doing in regards to air quality and potential safety hazards for individuals.

The expectationsis that these results can be used to produce rather precise predictions about how smelly the air in the given environment is.

People have a notion about what smells, machines need to do these predictions based on values from sensors.
The assumption is that the gas emissions of some chemical reactions, namely the ones where decomposition of organic materials is happening, always produce some specific gasses as a product.
It is based on our knowledge of these different gasses and how they smell - we assume that hightened concentrations of some of these gas types result in worse quality air.
