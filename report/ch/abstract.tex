Technology enhanced trash cans have already been subject to a lot of research and have become available as market products.
How the waste is handled has traditionally been a logistic issue, but it can also be approached differently.\\
This SmartBin perceives the trash as something more than a pile of waste - it is also something smelly!\\
We take a different angle on a known subject: waste management through smell detection.

The emphasis is on improving the indoor environment by monitoring air quality and smell levels emitting from the trash.
%The technology enhancing the bin uses sensors which detect gas emissions, mainly the ones occuring in decomposition of organic materials.
We developed a prototype able to measure and transmit trash status over the cloud, where the information can be accessed by various client devices like situated displays around the house and smartphones.
The system was evaluated by conducting user tests, the responses were both positive and negative
