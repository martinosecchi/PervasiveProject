Technology enhanced trash cans have already been subject to alot of research and have become available as market products.
How the waste is handled has traditionally been a logistics issue, but it can also be approached differently.\\
The SmartBin perceives the trash as something more than a pile of waste - it is also something smelly!\\
The emphasis is on improving the indoor environment to ultimately improve the quality of life by detecting odors.
The technology enhancing the bin uses sensors which detect gas emissions, mainly the ones occuring in decomposition of organic materials.
If any of these values exceed a threshold the SmartBin will react accordingly.
%Any specifics will be listed in the following document. This will range from hardware prototyping to evaluation of the product.
