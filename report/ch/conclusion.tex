The system described in this paper is a simple implementation of what waste management system can look like with the use of odor detection. 
It is designed for private usage inside the household, as one of the many different features that can turn a normal home into a smart home.

With the right IoT components, trash status can be easily monitored and transmitted, all with \textit{off-the-shelf} and relatively cheap components.

The main purpose of the system is to provide the means for monitoring trash conditions inside the house, and to act as a reminder to the users so that they can dispose of their waste before such conditions become problematic.

It's been discussed how taking smell into account for waste management could lead to better air and sanitary conditions around the trash.

Even existing systems could be adjusted to take into account the smell factor, all with relative ease and at a low price, just by adding a small sensor to their infrastructure.
