Multiple IoT based waste management systems have been developed. Some of them rely on RFID tagged containers which simplifies the detection of waste types for the containers.
Some of  them such as the system presented by Hong, park et. al., also include waste fees for disposal of food. This is done by introducing weightscales into the equation. The bigger amount disposed the bigger cost.
None of these rely on the actual waste though which is the novelty we want to introduce, the actual decomposition of waste and the causual emission of different gasses as results thereof.
