future work / discussion:
		
		air quality sensor sensitivity changes with humidity - temperature, and gas concentration
		in regard of gas concentration, it is highly sensible on low concentration, less for high concentrations.
		temperature: possible improvement, add a termometer to adjust sensor sensitivity, 
		e.g. in summer it can get pretty hot in a  trash can exposed to the sun.
