future work / discussion:
		
		air quality sensor sensitivity changes with humidity - temperature, and gas concentration
		in regard of gas concentration, it is highly sensible on low concentration, less for high concentrations.
		temperature: possible improvement, add a termometer to adjust sensor sensitivity, 
		e.g. in summer it can get pretty hot in a  trash can exposed to the sun.
		
Report style - paper (abstract, intro, system etc.)

What if? add data to wastebin - potential
Few users - but hands-on exposure

mention how systems can collaborate (maps for routes)
in general adding a parameter to the 'logistics' problem - (smell)

Api data could be used both for optimisation or just information in local scale

two stories:
	local/private
	global/API
Requirements for these
success for these	

dont promise too much - just state tht we will introduce a new angle

'AGREE on requirements for prototype'
