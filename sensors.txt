ultrasonic distance sensor, for low distance (some cm - 2 m)
infrared sensor for incidence of bin usage

gas sensor:
	possible candidates for trash smell are
		
		CO2 (odorless, but biproduct of a lot of decomposition processes), mostly "good" decomposition, aerobic process

		in lack of oxygen, "smellier" gases are produced:
		Hydrogen Sulphide H2S
		Ammonia
		
		Methane?

	unfortunately, different sensors for different gasses

networking
	LoRa, lack of infrastructure, long range, low power, but there would be the need for base stations

	normal mobile network might also work easy



list of possible gas sensors: 
	Arduino MQ serires
		MQ-2 Methane Buthane LPG smoke
		MQ-4 Methane CNG gas
		MQ-131 Ozone
		MQ-136 Hydrogen Sulphide
		MQ-137 Ammonia
		MQ-124 Methane Natural gas
		MG-811 CO2

		TGS2444, TGS826  Ammonia
		Methane: a lot
